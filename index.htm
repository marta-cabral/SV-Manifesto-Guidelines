          The Shared Visions identity is a living system — flexible, responsive, and grounded in a shared process. Born from the fog, it reflects the uncertainty and potential of creative collaboration.

While the identity evolves with the project, its foundational elements remain steady, ensuring clarity, coherence, and a collective voice throughout its expression.
